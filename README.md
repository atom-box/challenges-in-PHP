# Challenges
## Some of the sources
Exercism PHP track
Coding Bat (Stanford University)
## Done
PHPUnit installed (Installed twice: due to an error message during `Composer install` I reinstalled by the `wget` way)
## To do
Make the tests start passing.
## How to use
This was built with only the skeleton install of Symfony, to see what that is like.
PHPUnit runs for the Hamming test with:
`./vendor/bin/phpunit src/ExercismBundle/Tests/hamming_test.php`
